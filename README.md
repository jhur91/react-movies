# Ktown Finder
### This is a web app that allows users to post articles about Korean communities from all around the world.  It is a commonly used phrase in the Korean community, "you can find Koreans anywhere." From this idea, this app will help users learn about Korean communities from a user-to-user perspective. You may log in with your google account and add articles or comments.  If you would like to just read, then you do not need to log in.  Some features that users get are the adding, editing, and deleting of their own articles and comments!

# Next Steps
### Moving forward, I plan on improving the styling and user interface.  In terms of features, I would like to create a user profile page, with their user names as links to this page from the articles and comments.  In general, I would like to improve the user interface to be consistent with apps we use on a daily basis.
